Address Verification:

A geo-location-based accuracy check identifies whether physical verification is needed, reducing workload for the Sales team.
Rapid Lead Response System:

Analyzes lead response times to ensure timely connectivity within 15 minutes.
Propensity Model:

Uses Random Forest to predict lead-to-login conversion, boosting disbursements by 33%.
Lead Attribution:

Analyzes lead sources to attribute the most effective channels.
Alternate Channels:

Compares main branches and localized spokes for effectiveness.
Cross-Selling Strategy:

Behavioral analysis identifies Consumer Durables customers for cross-selling Personal Loans, increasing disbursal volume by 15%.
Visualization:

Visualizes disbursal amounts by lead source.

the terms F1 Score, Precision, and Support have the following meanings:

1. Precision
Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. It answers the question: "Of all the instances predicted as positive, how many are actually positive?"

Precision

 
High precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate.
2. Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)
Although not directly mentioned in your question, recall is a closely related metric. Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positive observations. It answers: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?"

3. F1 Score
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the two metrics and is especially useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.

High F1 Score indicates both high precision and high recall.
4. Support
Support is the number of actual occurrences of each class in the dataset. It helps understand the class distribution.

For example:
If Support = 50 for class 1, it means there are 50 actual positive cases.
Similarly, Support = 950 for class 0 indicates there are 950 actual negative cases.
